# Online Coding Hackathons and Competitions

* ### [ACM ICPC](https://https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)
> The ACM ICPC is considered as the "Olympics of Programming Competitions". It is simply, the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. Contestants participate in teams of 3 , representing their Universities work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. The winning Team gets a hefty prize money , but The ICPC isn't a matter of money , it's a matter of pride.

* ### [Google Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart)
> Kick Start is a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety of algorithmic challenges designed by Google engineers. Participants can compete in one or all online rounds held throughout the year, and will have the opportunity to develop and grow their programming abilities while getting a glimpse into the technical skills needed for a career at Google (top participants may be invited to interview at Google).

* ### [Google Code Jam](https://https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)
> Code Jam is Google's longest running global coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test ,  Competitors work their way through a series of online algorithmic puzzles to earn a spot at the World Finals, all for a chance to win the championship title and $15,000.

* ### [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup/)
> Hacker Cup is Facebook's annual open programming competition. Participants from all around the Globe participate to show their problem-solving skills. With each round increasingly difficult than the previous one , only a handful of contestants make it to the finals where a grand prize of $20,000 awaits them . Like Google Kickstart , Facebook Hacker Cup also started as a means to look for the best talent and recruit them in the bandwagon of the Tech Giant .
